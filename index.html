      </p>
      Dr. B. R.Ambedtkar was born as a Dalit and he was treated as an untouchable. 
      He was subjected to regular social and economic discrimination. Although Ambedkar attended school, he and other Dalit students were treated as untouchables. 
      They were separated from another group of students from other caste and were not given attention by the teachers. 
      They were even not allowed to sit with other students for their own drinking water.
      He used to drink water with the help of the peon as he and other Dalit students were not allowed to touch anything. 
      His father retired in 1894 and his mother passed away 2 years after they moved to Satara. Of all his brothers and sisters, Ambedkar was the only one who passed his examination and went to high school. Later in high school, his school, a Brahmin teacher, changed his surname from Ambadawekar, which was given by his father to Ambedkar in records. This shows the level of discrimination that was done on Dalits. Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar EducationIn 1897, Ambedkar became the only untouchable to get enrolled at the Elphinstone High School. 
      In 1906, Ambedkar, who was 15 years old, married a 9 years old named Ramabai.<br><br>
